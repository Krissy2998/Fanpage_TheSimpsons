    <p>I am a budding developer who ensure she finds time to keeps her inner child alive and thriving.</p>
    <p>This is acomplished by Rollerskating, Reading comic booked and of course, watching cartoons.</p>
    <p>I hope you will enjoy one of my all time favourite cartoon family,
    The Simpsons</p> 
    <p>My love for The Simpsons stems back over 20 years when I moved to the UK from the Caribbean and I found such a comfort and calm by having The Simpson on telly every evening.</p>
    <p>This was a time long before the many streaming and on demand services we have at our disposal.</p>
    <p>Over the years I have learnt, laughed and enjoyed the many adventures and misadventures they have 
    experienced, therefore I chose dedicate my project to a part of my childhood that I intend to enjoy for many more years to come.
